/**
 * Drain the candidate queue into memory.
 *
 * Both proposal doors — the MCP server's `propose_memory` and the
 * noticer's extraction pass — still write to `pending.jsonl`. Keeping
 * that transport means one write implementation instead of two (one in
 * Rust, one in TS) that could drift on topic routing or attribution.
 * What changed is what happens next: candidates are applied immediately
 * rather than waiting for a click, and the user sees them as *recently
 * added* entries they can delete.
 *
 * Serialized on purpose: the drain runs from a few places (chat idle,
 * Settings mount, focus) and applying the same candidate twice would
 * duplicate a bullet.
