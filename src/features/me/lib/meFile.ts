## About me

*A quick introduction, in a sentence or two — your name, where you live,
what you do with your days, who and what matters to you. Whatever helps
an agent get who it's talking to.*

## How to work with me

*How you like information delivered — brief or thorough, bullets or prose,
lead with the answer or walk through the reasoning.*

## Preferences

*Defaults you want agents to respect — tools you use, formats you like,
things you always want done a certain way.*

## Boundaries

*Things agents should always ask about first, or never do at all.*

## Standing rules

*Rules for every agent, every time — like "draft anything sent on my behalf
and show me first," or "prefix messages sent for me with 🤖."*

## Topics

*Deeper knowledge lives in its own topic files in a "topics" folder here —
like "style.md" or "family.md". Agents only read a topic when that part
of your life is what's going on. Add one in Settings, or just tell Berdy.*
